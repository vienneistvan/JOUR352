<h2> <font color= "orange">Kristina Dahl, senior
climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, called California the "land of extremes."</font></h2>

<p> <font color= "brown">Floods, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, and earthquakes are constantly affecting the residents of California. Will these natural disasters push the residents out? </font></p>

<p> <font color="brown"> ALthough these disasters have not come to a halt, California's population continues to grow. Michael Lens, an associate professor of urban planning and
public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, told ABC News that there is a high desirability to live in California and this is driving up the cost of living.</font></p>
<div class="container">
<h2> "This is especially true in the desirable coastal cities, such as San
Francisco and Los Angeles, but also further inland, where it's almost
impossible to buy a starter home for less than $500,000, even $1 million
in some markets, Lens said.
It's easy to look around and question whether continuing to live in
California is the best idea as the extreme weather events are occurring,
Lens said. But once the sky clears, so do those fleeting moments of
uncertainty."</h2>

<h2> <font color= "orange"> According to a study conducted
by real estate company Redfin in 2021, prices of homes inside fire-prone areas went up by 21% and houses outside of that area rose by 33%</font></h2>

<p> <font color="brown">California does not stand alone in terms of extreme weather, and it all depends on what people are and are not willing to risk. Climate change is happening everywhere, and if you can't escape it then it's a game of "pick your poison."
</font></p>

<h2> <font color= "orange"> Toursim levels in California are almost back to where they were before the pandemic</font></h2>

<p> <font  color="brown">California may be deteriorating from climate change at a faster rate than others, but it remains a big tourism spot because it has not lost its appeal. This appeal being the gorgeous scenery, countless activities, and overall social rank."Visit California research continues to show a strong desire among travel
consumers to enjoy the Golden State's multitude of tourism experiences,
its diversity and welcoming, free-spirited ethos," Beteta said. </font> </p>
